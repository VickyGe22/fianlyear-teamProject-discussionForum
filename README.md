# Project 14B: CodeInsight

CodeInsight is a Next.js-based project that aims to help instructors upload and discuss suboptimal code samples.

## Project Introduction

The goal of CodeInsight is to achieve milestone 1 first by building an example code submission and discussion forum pages, which will allow instructors to upload suboptimal code samples and exchange ideas.

## Project Management

We will use a Git project to manage our tasks, including Todo, In Progress, and Done(seperate based on three main pages) statuses. Each team member will work on their own origin branch and regularly merge updates to the develop branch. All team members need to reach a consensus before merging to the develop branch.

### Task Allocation
1. **Task Allocation**: In the Git project, we will divide tasks into Todo, In Progress, and Done statuses. Each team member is responsible for claiming and completing their own tasks.

2. **Branch Management**: Each team member will work on their own origin branch. After completing a task, they need to merge their origin branch to the develop branch.

3. **Merge Strategy**: Before merging updates to the develop branch, we need to get the consent of other team members. We will use discussions and reviews to ensure code quality and consistency.

4. **Milestone Management**: We will break down milestone1 into multiple sub-tasks and record them in the Git project. As we complete each sub-task, we will update the task status and discuss the next steps.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Team members need to regularly update their task progress, so that others can understand the project's progress. We will discuss the project progress and solve any issues during our weekly meetings.

Through the above project management strategies, we hope to efficiently complete the CodeInsight milestone1 and lay a good foundation for future development.

### Task Assignment
For details on assignment, see the milestone1's todo, in progress, and done lists in our Git project.

## Tech

We will use the following technology stack to build CodeInsight:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Headless UI
- Heroicons
- Sticky.js
- CodeMirror

### Next.js Guideline

1. Open the project directory: `cd codeinsight`
2. Install the environment: `npm install`
3. Install additional dependencies:
   - `npm install sticky-js`
   - `npm install @tailwindcss/forms`
   - `npm install @headlessui/react`
   - `npm install @heroicons/react`
   - `npm install codemirror`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
