## Github:	
1. We start coding from week 5 followed by the gitflow cooperation methods proposed by Shiwen Cao (a shared branch named 'develop' and 5 origin branches for each team member):
  At the first few weeks, I was responsible to build up the basic structure, layout and router (empty content) for our project including the homepage, submit page, discussion page and review page. Then, update the tailwind css file that to ensure the whole team work on the same theme style. Besides, creating common header, footer,  and navigation-bar for share ui. After that, my main job is to optimize the UI for home page. These files could be found in Team-14/codeinsight/components;Team-14/codeinsight/app/css;Team-14/codeinsight/app/(root)/page.tsx; 
2. We used issues in GitHub to assign tasks. After finishing my own part, I made a 'pull request', waiting for our project team to megre it to develop branch.
3. Documentation work is saved at Team-14/ProjectManagementFolder/.

## Contributions:
During the project process, I was assigned as product owner to oversee the overall project development cycle and manage milestones to ensure the project stays on schedule. Correspondingly, I made important contributions in the technical aspect, responsible for the structural design of the project, the development of front-end functions, the implementation of GET requests for back-end API, the writing of Authentication functions, and various key features (these contributions can be verified in the GitHub submission history). The details are as follows:

a) Structural design of Next.js framework based on project requirements: I designed folder structure according to the requirements, defined environment specifications and global CSS styles to ensure page adaptive display on both desktop and mobile devices, and implemented core UI components such as navigation bar, side bar, header, footer, and modal popups. 

b) Front-end function contribution: Zhangchi Pan and I implemented the user interface of code sample library; Jingqi Wang and I developed the interface for discussion forum page and acceptance page.

c) Data structure design: I designed data structure to save comments and replies in discussion forum and user information.

d) Back-end API implementation: Lanxi Zhang and I conducted API files to ensure code samples saved in database can display in the user interface at the real-time.

e) Authentication function:  I implemented JWT and bcryptJs API for Authentication and designed role-based permission control.

f) Key features: I contributed to the automatic tag filling function and print function.

g) Performance testing: I wrote and executed performance test scripts to check the response speed and stability of the application under various loads.

h) Project management contribution: I created and maintained project to-do lists and scrum boards on github to clearly demonstrate task progress and priorities.
